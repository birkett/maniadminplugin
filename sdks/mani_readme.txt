This is where SDK's will need to be placed for compiling.
A SDK for Counter-Strike: Source would go into the "css" folder. Below are a list of folders for each SDK compatible with Mani.

/csgo  (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive)
/css   (Counter-Strike: Source)
/dods  (Day of Defeat: Source)
/hl2dm (Half-Life 2: Deathmatch)
/tf2   (Team Fortress 2)
