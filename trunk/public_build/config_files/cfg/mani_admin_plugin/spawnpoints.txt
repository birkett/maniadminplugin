//
// This is the spawnpoints.txt file
// for the mani_admin_plugin V1.2 Beta G+.
//
// In the previous versions you needed to include existing spawnpoints
// but now you only specify extra spawnpoints required.
//
// If you want to define your own extra spawnpoints, put them
// in here. 
//
// The points provided here are EXISTING spawnpoints from the CSS map
// de_dust and are the default ones provided as examples.
//
// If you want more then add more onto the end of each
// team list. (If you look in the gametypes.txt file
// you can work out which team index is which).
//
// For other maps you can use the new server console command
// ma_dumpspawnpoints. This will dump the standard spawnpoints
// into a file called 'clipboard.txt' in the server /mani_admin_plugin/
// directory. You can then use this to workout where the extra
// spawnpoints should be added.
//
// The format for each spawn point is based on 6 numbers
// The first 3 are the positional information of x,y,z coordinates
//
// The last 3 relate to the angle at which you are looking. Usually
// only the second number in the angle needs to be changed for the start
// y direction axis.
