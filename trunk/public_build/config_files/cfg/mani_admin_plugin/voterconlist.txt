// Place all your Yes/No Rcon vote questions and commands in here
//
// This file uses aliases.
//
// Aliases are what is shown in the menu system
// a nice way of presenting the commands.
// Aliases must be enclosed in quotes
//
// E.G. "Low Gravity"
//
// Do not put another quote inside like :-
//
// "Low "Gravity""
//
// The text after the alias is the question that will be asked and must also
// be enclosed in quotes " "
//
// The text after the question string is the actual command that
// will be run if the result of the vote is 'Yes'
//

"All Talk On" "Shall we turn on all talk ?" sv_alltalk 1 	// Turn on all talk vote
