// crontablist.txt
//
// Place all your server commands that you want
// executed at the start of each map during
// specified times of particular days
//
// The first field defines the days of the week
// that the command will be run. If the field
// is left as "" the command will be run every day of the week
//
// Days of the week are
//
// 1 = Sunday
// 2 = Monday
// 3 = Tuesday
// 4 = Wednesday
// 5 = Thursday
// 6 = Friday
// 7 = Saturday
//
// To have a command run on Tuesday and Friday use
// the day string
// 
// "36"
//
// For Monday, Wednesday and Saturday use: -
//
// "247"
//
// The second field defines the time of day that
// the server should run the command and is setup
// in the following format "HH:MI-HH:MI"
//
// Start time to End time
//
// "09:30-14:10"
//
// The above time range is from 9.30am to 2:10pm. The time
// format MUST be in military 24 hour style, any hours below 10:00 must
// start with a preceeding 0 as in 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, you must
// not use 1:10 for instance.
//
// The third field instructs the server the command
// to run at the start of each map during that time
// period. For example 
//
// "" "09:30-15:10" exec daytime_config.cfg
//
// The above line will run the command 'exec daytime_config.cfg' 
// on the start of each map during the time period 09.30 upto and
// including 15:10 for every day of the week. 
// If you only wanted it to run on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
// the line would look like
//
// "246" "09:30-15:10" exec daytime_config.cfg
//
// The default configuration is to run your command before
// any custom map config is run (see map_configs folder)
//
// If you place a # symbol before the server command it will
// be run after any custom map config is exectuted.
//
// "" "19:00-21:59" #sv_gravity 800
//
// The above command will be run from 19:00 to and including
// 21:59 each time a map starts but after any custom map configs.
// In this case if you have a low grav map that uses a custom map
// config to set sv_gravity to say 150. The above command will 
// override that setting.
//
// You can have as many entries in this file as you wish.
