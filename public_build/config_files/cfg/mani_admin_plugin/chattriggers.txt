	// Mani Admin Plugin 2005 V1.2 Onwards
	//
	// This file is currently used for blocking say commands. This is
	// useful for things like HLstatsX to block spam from the in game console.
	// HLstatsX uses commands like /rank, session to get real time data.
	// 
	// This file will be expanded over time to provide more functionality other
	// than just ignoring chat phrases.
	//

	"Ignore"
	{
		// Any triggers in this section will be completely
		// blocked from being seen in the game. The chat however
		// will still provide an event for other plugins and still
		// output to the standard Valve logs. These commands will
		// block default chat commands in the Mani Admin Plugin from
		// running at all.

		// Examples shown below that are commented out.

		// "1"	"rank"
		// "2"	"top10"
		// "3"	"session"
	}

	"Ignore X Times"
	{
		// Any triggers in this section will block described chat
		// commands from being shown until the Xth time that the 
		// number field specifies. For instance having the chattrigger
		// "rank" "5" would mean that when rank is typed, it is only 
		// displayed to the user once after 5 attempts. This cuts down
		// on spam and also allows the command to still be used by the
		// plugin
		
		// Example shown below that are commented out.

		// "weaponme"	"5"
		// "hitboxme"	"4"
		// "statsme"	"6"
